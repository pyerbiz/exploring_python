Snippets, Notes, and Stack Overflow references, related to the material in the book 'Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs in Python'. This book is derived from the classic textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. John Denero originally modified if for Python for the Fall 2011 semester. It is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license.

Reference to the book - [SICP in Python](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/book/) and related course - [Standford CS61A computer science course](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp12/)

The notes are chapter wise and contain:

- Functional Programming basics, Recursion, Higher order functions, constraint programming, asbstraction and combination.
- Data Abstaction, Implementation of python tuples, lists, dictionaries using Functional Programming
- OOP, Implementation of Classes,  Objects using dictionaries and closures.
- Recursive Data Structures, Hierarchial Data Structures, O(n) Notation, Exceptions
- Interpreters for languages with combination
- Interpreters for languates with abstraction
- Distributd and Parallel Computing
- Sequences and Coroutines

I highly recommend reading this book for developing a good understanding of how a programming language is built, how it works and what are its features. This is not a book for learning Python, it contains very little syntactic study.
