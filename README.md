# Make a developer

This repository is my reference for python language, algorithms and data structures. The idea is a beginner can learn advanced python by going through this repository and read the reference material. Or, reader can make skills sharper.

order of complexity (by folder names) for beginner in programming:

1. sicp: Structure and Implementation of Computer Programs in Python.
2. understanding_algo: for algorithmic thinking.
3. effective_python: intermediate to advanced python concepts, meant for writing better Python.
4. awesome_libraries: study on standard python libraries that should be used by a developer.
5. collected_helpers: a log of re-usable utility objects in above modules.
